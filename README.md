Head-First Tokenization: A Look at NLTK Tokenizers
This Jupyter Notebook explores the functionality of two tokenizers provided by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): TreebankWordTokenizer and wordpunct_tokenize. It highlights their differences in how they handle punctuation, particularly periods (dots).

Goals:

Understand the concept of tokenization in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Compare and contrast the behavior of TreebankWordTokenizer and wordpunct_tokenize.
Gain insights into how different tokenizers can affect downstream NLP tasks.
Content:

Introduction to NLTK and tokenization.
Demonstration of TreebankWordTokenizer behavior.
Illustration of wordpunct_tokenize behavior.
Comparison of the tokenized outputs.
Discussion of implications for NLP tasks.
Running the Notebook:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sriraman-10/head_first_tokens.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Head_first_tokenization.ipynb

Key Learnings:

Tokenization methods can vary in how they handle punctuation.
The choice of tokenizer can impact the results of NLP tasks.
Understanding tokenizer behavior is crucial for effective NLP processing.
